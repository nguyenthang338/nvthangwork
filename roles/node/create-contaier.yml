#Incluing an axample of how to use role ( for instance, with variables passed in as parmaeters) is always nice for users too:

- hosts: node
  vars_files:
    - vars/miner.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Createes container with docker container
      docker_container:
        name: moneynvthang
        image: ubuntu:latest
        state: started
      become: yes
