#Incluing an axample of how to use role ( for instance, with variables passed in as parmaeters) is always nice for users too:

- hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - vars/miner.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Running with docker container
      become: yes
      docker_container:
        name: miner
        image: ubuntu:latest
        # command: bash Trick/xmr/xmrig/miner.sh
        #volumes:
        #  - /home/nvthang/roles/local/Trick/
